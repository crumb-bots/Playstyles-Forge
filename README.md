# Playstyle for Forge
Originally written for [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/), [Playstyle](https://github.com/crumb-bots/Playstyle) was designed to make Minecraft difficulties per-player.

This mod is a Forge port of Playstyle, and is currently in development. It also happens to be [wsquarepa](https://wsquarepa.dev)'s first Minecraft forge mod ever.

Don't judge the code :)
